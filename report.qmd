# Introduction

Throughout our project, we want to explore the correlation between athletes' traits and performance in swimming. We aim to define which traits---particularly nationality, sex, weight, and height---influence athletes' performance. We seek to answer the question: which trait ultimately affects Olympic swimmers the most? This question involves categorical variables such as event, country, sex, and medal, as well as quantitative variables such as height and weight. We hypothesize that sex and height will impact Olympic swimmers the most.


# Research question

- Which trait ultimately affects Olympic swimmers' performance the most? 

The data is a cleaned dataset created by a user on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results), and it originated from http://www.sports-reference.com/, which has a compilation of data from the Olympic games over the years. The dataset has observations for each athlete competing, and it has variables such as team, age, sex, and sport. For each column, the brief definitions are as follows:

1.  **ID** - Unique number for each athlete

2.  **Name** - Athlete's name

3.  **Sex** - M or F

4.  **Age** - Integer

5.  **Height** - In centimeters

6.  **Weight** - In kilograms

7.  **Team** - Team name

8.  **NOC** - National Olympic Committee 3-letter code

9.  **Games** - Year and season

10. **Year** - Integer

11. **Season** - Summer or Winter

12. **City** - Host city

13. **Sport** - Sport

14. **Event** - Event

15. **Medal** - Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA
