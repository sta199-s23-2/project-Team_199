This question could be important in knowing which events are the most predictable, and which may be more contested, which could guide coverage of the events. We predict that the events that tend to be dominated by one country, such as freestyle skiing (dominated by Canada) will have the best predictive models.\nThe question involves categorical variables such as event, country, sex, and medal, as well as quantitative variables such as height and weight."

This provides a decent basis to form a hypothesis, as particularly dominated sports may be more easily predicted than tossup sports. The article also suggests that continent, and not just country, could be a basis to sort athletes in order to predict results.\nThe article does not go into depth regarding whether any of the events can be predicted year-to-year, so it can easily be expanded on."
